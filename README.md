# 🏫 Air Pollution Exposure Near Schools in Île-de-France

This project analyzes modeled air pollution data around schools and daycare centers in the Île-de-France region (including Paris) between 2012 and 2017. It explores trends in NO₂, PM10, and PM2.5 concentrations, identifies high-risk areas, and offers data-driven recommendations for safe school construction and public health interventions.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Evaluate and visualize pollution exposure near educational institutions to inform parents, urban planners, and policymakers.
- **Region:** Île-de-France (Paris and surrounding areas)
- **Years Covered:** 2012–2017
- **Pollutants Analyzed:**
  - NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)
  - PM10 (Particulate Matter ≤10µm)
  - PM2.5 (Particulate Matter ≤2.5µm)

---

## 🧪 Data Source

The data is compiled from multiple public datasets and modeled pollution values:

- 🗂 [Main Dataset - data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/cc16163c-aca0-4977-97da-8ce592f78de1)
- EAJE (childcare institutions database)
- School address data (primary and secondary)
- Airparif-modeled annual air quality files (by pollutant and year)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint (for final presentation)
- GitHub for version control
- Visual design tools (for poster)

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- 📉 Trend lines of NO₂, PM10, and PM2.5 from 2012–2017
- 📊 Correlation matrix of pollutants
- 🗺️ Pollution heatmap of Paris arrondissements
- 🏙️ Safe vs. unsafe zones for schools
- 📍 Bar charts by school capacity and safety level

## ✅ Recommendations

- Prioritize school construction in arrondissements 75015 and 75016
- Freeze construction in high-risk zones (75004, 75020)
- Install air filters and rooftop gardens in marginal zones (e.g., 75010)
- Link urban permits to pollution monitoring
